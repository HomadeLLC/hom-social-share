A lightweight JavaScript utility that copies the current page URL to the clipboard and shows a temporary notification ("toast") to the user.

---

- Displays a clean, fade-in/out toast message at the bottom of the screen
- Requires **no external dependencies**
- Ideal for share buttons or social link features

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use


### 1. Add the Script

Include this in your website (e.g., Webflow's Footer Code section)
Update the v=1 to v=2, v=3, etc. to bust the cache when you update the file.

In your HTML (or Webflow Designer):

<a href="#" id="data-copy-button">Copy Link</a>
The element must have the ID data-copy-button

Optionally add a class for styling (e.g., blog-post2-content_social-link)

## Toast Styling

The notification is styled inline inside the notifyUser() function.
You can customize the following properties:

backgroundColor
padding
font, borderRadius, boxShadow, etc.

## Notes
The script listens for DOMContentLoaded before initializing

It gracefully handles missing elements or copy failures

Can be extended to support multiple buttons using data- attributes
